# ARC radiogalaxies' SED fit
* The present code is used for fitting the SEDs of 44 radiogalaxies which are part of the ARC survey. 
* The code uses parametrised template SED libraries for stellar populations, diffuse ISM dust, accretion disk, dusty torus.
* The code fits template combinations to SED data which are part of the SED database of the ARC survey.

This code is used and extensively described in "Evolution of Stellar Mass Function for radiogalaxies up to z âˆ¼2.5", which can be found [here](https://github.com/mkourakou/MSc_thesis.git ).
